<h1>The Dancer</h1>
<p>(30 x 36)<br /><br />The Dancer embodies the passion to express a dimension of life just beyond the five senses. When the Dancer is fully present in her body, none of her gestures are empty or meaningless. They seem to come from a deeper source, and reach into a deeper place in her audience's perception.  The signature of the Dancer is not in what they do but how intense their motivation is to manifest the extraordinary. The lizards in the painting are seekers of the sun to enlighten their souls.  The gregarious springbokkies (jumping gazelles) are known for their high leaps. The shadow Artist comprises many cliches, including the eccentric nature and the madness that often accompanies genius. The Starving Artist represents the fear of financial ruin or the belief that fame and fortune come only after death. The need to bring art to others, such as dedicating part of your life to supporting artists is as much an expression of the Artist archetype as holding a brush in your hand.</p><p>This painting is available in alternative giclee print sizes.<br />Size A: 8 x 10<br />Size B: 11 x 14</p>
