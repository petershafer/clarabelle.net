<h1>Makasonke (Little Prince)</h1>
<p>(24 x 30)<br /><br />This is a painting of my Nanny whose baby boy died.  She had lived in a remote area in Zulu land where there wasn't any medical attention for miles. As the condition worsened she made her way down the dirt road to the  clinic and the child died in her arms.  Grief stricken she told me afterwards: "My eyes don't want to stop raining."</p><p>This painting is available in alternative giclee print sizes.<br />Size A: 8 x 10<br />Size B: 11 x 14</p>
